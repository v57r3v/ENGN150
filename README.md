Design Project 2 
Preliminary   Design of a Truss   Bridge
Description: The   local   council   in your   city   is   required to   connect two   riverbanks   by   a truss   bridge   like the   one   in Figure   1. The designs, and their   development,   should   comply   with   relevant   requirements   including:
•             Manufacturer's guidelines and   specifications   such   as the   bridge   must   be   capable   of   safely   carrying the weight of the deck, the weight of the   main trusses, and the weight   of   one standard   H25 truck   loading   per   lane.
•             Sustainable   design   principles
•             Australian   standards
•               Code of   practice
•             Health, safety,   and   environmental   requirements  

Figure   1: Sample   proposed Truss   Bridge   [1]  
The   requirements   of   the   bridge   areas   follows: 
1. The Problem: You are a civil designer working   for the   State   Department   of   Transportation.   You   have   been assigned   responsibility for the design of a truss   bridge to   carry   a two-lane   highway      across the   river valley   shown   below.

2. Design Objective: Satisfy   all the   specifications   listed   below,   while   keeping   the total   cost   of the   project as   low as   possible. The estimated cost   of the   project   is   between   $5M –   $7M.
3. Bridge Configuration 
1.          The   bridge   may cross the valley at any elevation from   the   high-water   level   to   24   meters   above the   high-water   level.
2.       If the elevation   of the   bridge   is   below   24   meters, excavation   of the   riverbanks   will   be   required to achieve the correct   highway   elevation.
3.       To   provide clearance for overhead   power   lines   (shown   above), the   highest   point   on   the bridge   may   not exceed an elevation of 32.5   meters   above the   high-water   level   (8.5   meters   above the top of the   riverbanks) and 10   meters wide. The deck   of the   bridge will   be   made      from a   Medium-strength concrete thickness of 23 centimetres   (0.23   metres). 
4. Member Properties 
•            Materials.   Each   member of the truss will   be   made of carbon steel.
•          The   members of the truss   can   be   either   solid   bars   or   hollow tubes.   Both   types   of   cross-   loads
5. Cost 
The cost of the design will   be calculated   using the following   cost factors:
•             Material   Cost:
•            Carbon steel   bars   -   $4.50   per   kilogram
•          Carbon   steel   tubes   -   $6.30   per   kilogram
•          Reinforced concrete   deck   (medium   strength)   -   $5,150   per   4-meter   panel
•            Each   joint connector costs   $500.00
Required: 
1.             Make a detailed   list   of all   constraints   and   requirements   for the   bridge   design.
2.            Prepare functional specifications.
3.          Present your design to   代 写ENGN150 – Fundamentals of Engineering Studies Design Project 2Haskell

4.          Construction   materials   and   services   quantities
5.            Construction cost estimates.
6.            Standard engineering drawings of scale (1 : 200)
